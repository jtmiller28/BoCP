## Purpose: This is step 1 when trying to align a large table of names to taxonomic backbones
## This script is designed to take in a database and deal with standardizing the data into a form that can be processed through my alignment fxns
## As its impossible to guess all the nuances that can come up with any particular taxonomic backbone, the preview of this script is designed to give a reproducible example of what the end output should look like.
