### Data Downloads 
Data was aquired from GBIF, iDigBio, and Symbiota. In Rscripts, the section 002 have A,B,and C variations that represent iDigBio, GBIF, and symbiota data downloads repectively. For iDigBio and GBIF, data was downloaded using the gatoRs package (v. 1.0.2), with slightly modified functions (see gators-fxns-edited.R) to split iDigBio and GBIF downloads apart (for job allocation and speed). In these 2 scripts the following occurs: 
1) Load in the wcvp name alignment, and create a nested list that contains the acceptedName and all of its associated synonyms. Note that for our purposes, we used the acceptedNameParent field which is collapses all subspecific variations of taxon(s) into the parent Genus + specificEpithet. 
2) A retry download function was written with a tryCatch error handler. Basically this attempts to use gatoRs download (edited) to ping iDigBio or GBIF for the name and associated synonyms, if the name is not found at all its sent to a failed_names.csv for recording purposes. If a name is found, we proceed to write it out as a .csv where in the directories BoCP/data/gbif-dws/raw/ or BoCP/data/idigbio-dws/raw/ with the name of the acceptedNameParent as the file delimiter e.g. 'Rafinesquia-neomexicana.csv'. The counts of each data pull are also stored in the ../data/gbif-dws/raw-dw-info-tbls/raw-info-tbl-final.csv. 
3) The names were then looped through using this function to call and write out the data for GBIF and iDigBio. Note that for speed reasons we also created subset R scripts with associated SLURM schedulers, these are simply here to speed up the overall download speed (specifically from GBIF's api). 
4) For Symbiota data, Ed Gilbert provided vascular plant data in North America on 06/14/2024 that does not exist in GBIF/iDigBio. This data was simply loaded into R, then the field scientificName was searched for parent species.
